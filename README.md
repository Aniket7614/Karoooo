1- Attached the sample test zip
2- Open and Unzip the file

4- It will show the login page UI, where I have used "Username" & "Password" to login along with the register button.
5- First, click on the register button, it will navigate to "Register page" where you will be asked to register yourself with "Username" & "Password".
6- After successfull registration you will get a alert message "Registration successfull", click on "Ok" button of alert and it will pop you to the login page.
7- Enter same "Username" & "Password" to login into the application, as you have created earlier. Invalid inputs will give you the error message.
8- Login & Registration are done through Sqlite database as per requirement. Also, in UI I have used material design for textfield as per requirements.
9- After successfull login , you will be navigated to Master detail page where you can see the list of details coming from API response.https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users.
10- Click on latitude & longitude & it will show you the map view.
